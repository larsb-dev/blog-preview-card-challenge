## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I don't know if this is normal, but I tend to struggle with identifying elements that share common styles. I'm a bit obsessed about the DRY principle and want to write the most reusable CSS classes possible. During this project I've worked with a Figma file for the first time and I've created styles for the text and spacing according to the style guide. For example, I've set up `.text-preset-2` and `.text-preset-2-bold` classes. The common styles are in the first class and the second class only contains the styles to make the text bold. I find it awesome that Figma allows you to copy CSS custom properties and other code snippets directly into your CSS file.

### Pixel Perfect

I tried my best to make this site look as close to the original design as possible. I inspected the elements in Figma which was a lot of fun.

### Continued development

I want to continue with project-based learning and I hope that if I will use a CSS framework in the future, it will make the class-selection more straightforward.
